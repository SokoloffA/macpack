# macpack

The **macpack** is a utility for building Mac OS bundles and packages. The program is inspired by [flatpack-builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder.html) and partly by [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

The program reads a SPEC file and builds a ready-to-install application bundle, or pkg file.

If you want more information about SPEC file format and options, see [this document](SPEC-FILE.md).

## SPEC file example
```yaml

```


## Instalation
All you need to install macpack is one file, the binary itself. It's as simple as that!

Download the binary from the releases page.
